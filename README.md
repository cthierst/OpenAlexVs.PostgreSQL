# OpenAlexVs.PostgreSQL

## A Comparison of the Usability and Sustainability of OpenAlex and PostgreSQL from a Beginner Perspective

## Overview
This repository contains all input files necessary to extract Univeristy of Toronto Springer data from OpenAlex and PostgreSQL. The aim of this comparison is to determine the usability of the data and the sustainability of using these resources, with an emphasis on a beginner perspective.

## Requirements
The code requires RStudio and MobaXterm. To run the code stored in this github, you will need to have both of these installed. We recommend using RStudio on your local computer or Posit Cloud as your IDE. To use wos postgresql you will need to have access from your institution and follow steps to be permitted access. This is a link to the University of Toronto's guide to gain access: [How to Access the PostgreSQL Databases](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/how-access-postgresql-databases)
